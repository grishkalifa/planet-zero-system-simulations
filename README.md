# Planet Zero — System Dynamics Simulations

## Overview
This repository contains a series of **system dynamics simulations** designed to study how complex systems behave under different governance rules, feedback loops, and constraints.

The project is part of a broader exploration into **AGI-relevant system design**, focusing on how adaptive rules and internal state variables can produce stable, scalable, and resilient behavior without centralized optimization.

Each simulation represents a **completed modeling stage**, following strict requirements:
- Clear stocks and flows
- Reinforcing and balancing feedback loops
- Base case and alternative scenarios
- Visual dashboards
- Written conclusions and interpretation

---

## Motivation
Most systems fail not because they lack ambition, but because they lack **good internal governance**.

Rather than optimizing for a single metric (profit, growth, or impact), this project explores how **systems can self-regulate** when designed with the right internal feedback mechanisms.

This approach is directly relevant to:
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Complex adaptive systems
- Organizational and economic system design
- Governance of autonomous agents

The core question across simulations is:

> *How can we design systems that make good decisions automatically, even under uncertainty and growth?*

## Planet Zero — Conceptual System
Planet Zero is modeled as a **self-governing socio-economic system**.

### Core philosophy
- Money never leaves the system arbitrarily
- Every surplus is reinvested according to internal state
- Survival precedes growth
- Growth precedes impact at scale

### Main internal stocks
- **BC (Capital Pool):** long-term investment capital (e.g. government bonds)
- **BPZ (Planet Zero Pool):** operational and impact allocation
- **FS (Survival Fund):** emergency and resilience buffer, measured in months of operating costs

### Governance rule (central idea)
Instead of fixed percentages, Planet Zero uses an adaptive rule:

\[
p = f(FS)
\]

Where:
- **p** = fraction of net utility allocated to BC
- **FS** = internal survival coverage (months of costs)

This allows the system to:
- Behave conservatively when fragile
- Invest aggressively when safe
- Grow without risking collapse

---

## Interest Accounting (Critical Design Choice)
Interest generated by BC and FS is treated as **system income**, not automatically capitalized.

Monthly utility is defined as:

\[
U = Revenue + Interest - Costs
\]

If and only if **U > 0**, it is redistributed according to the governance policy.

This avoids double-counting interest and ensures:
- All gains follow the same governance rules
- No hidden compounding outside system control
- Full transparency of system dynamics

## Completed Simulations

### Simulation 1 — Amazon Deforestation System
**Domain:** Ecological system  

**Goal:**  
Model the long-term behavior of deforestation under different regimes and identify tipping points and irreversible collapse thresholds.

**Key focus:**
- Natural resource as a finite stock
- Reinforcing and balancing feedback loops
- System collapse under unchecked extraction
- Long-term irreversible dynamics

### Simulation 2 — Planet Zero Governance & Viability
**Domain:** Socio-economic / organizational system  

This simulation is divided into two explicit phases.

#### Phase 1 — Reinvestment Governance
**Question:**  
If net utility exists, how should it be divided to maximize long-term stability and growth?

**Key insight:**  
Fixed reinvestment percentages are suboptimal.  
Adaptive governance based on **FS** produces more resilient behavior.

FS acts as a global regulating variable:
- Low FS → prioritize survival
- High FS → increase investment and growth

---

#### Phase 2 — Economic Viability
**Question:**  
Under what conditions does the system produce sustained positive utility?

Key findings:
- Governance is irrelevant if utility is negative
- There exists a clear viability threshold defined by:
  - number of people
  - margin per person
  - fixed operational costs
- Growth happens in steps, not smoothly
- Hiring increases capacity but also raises the bar for survival

To avoid hidden assumptions, Phase 2 uses:
- **Exogenous revenue growth** (explicitly controlled)
- Fixed people and margin dynamics
- Clear separation between business viability and governance intelligence

## Why This Matters for AGI
These simulations are not about prediction — they are about **designing intelligent behavior**.

Relevance to AGI includes:
- Internal state–based decision making
- Rule-based governance instead of target optimization
- Emergent intelligence from feedback loops
- Safety through survival-first constraints
- Transferable design principles for autonomous agents

The same logic applies to:
- AGI resource allocation
- Autonomous organizations
- Self-governing economic agents
- Alignment-aware system architectures
