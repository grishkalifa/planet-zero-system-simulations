## Objective
Phase 2 was designed to answer a fundamental question:

> Can Planet Zero function at all before governance and impact are considered?

This phase isolates **economic viability** from governance intelligence.

---

## Core Assumptions
- All costs are already included in operating expenses
- Utility is calculated as:
  
  \[
  U = Revenue + Interest - Costs
  \]

- Interest from capital pools is treated as income and redistributed
- Revenue growth is exogenous and explicitly controlled
- People and margin dynamics are frozen to avoid hidden optimization

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Viability is a hard threshold
If revenue does not cover costs:
- FS cannot grow
- BC cannot compound
- Governance rules are irrelevant

The system either:
- produces sustained positive utility, or
- never exits survival mode

There is no partial success.

---

### 2. Governance only matters after viability
Phase 1 governance policies assume:
- U > 0 exists

Phase 2 shows that without viability:
- adaptive reinvestment cannot activate
- impact cannot scale
- hiring becomes destructive

This establishes a strict ordering:
1. Viability
2. Survival buffer
3. Growth
4. Impact

---

### 3. Growth occurs in discrete steps
Hiring decisions increase system capacity but also:
- raise operating costs
- increase FS targets
- temporarily slow growth

The system grows **by plateaus**, not smoothly.

This behavior is emergent, not imposed.

---

### 4. Interest must be handled carefully
The simulation confirms:
- interest must not be double-counted
- capital appreciation must follow governance rules
- treating interest as system income preserves consistency

This is essential for:
- correctness
- interpretability
- AGI-aligned design

---

## Final Insight
Planet Zero is not optimized for speed, profit, or impact.

It is optimized for:
- survival
- internal coherence
- long-term adaptability

Phase 2 proves that **good governance cannot save a non-viable system**, but once viability exists, adaptive governance can scale impact safely.

---

## Relevance to AGI
This phase demonstrates:
- separation of feasibility and intelligence
- internal-state-driven decision rules
- avoidance of reward hacking
- emergence of rational behavior from constraints

These are core principles for building aligned autonomous systems.
